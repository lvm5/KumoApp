This repository brings together two projects developed as part of the learning journey in the iOS Lab School and personal practices of SwiftUI.
Both explore concepts of minimalist design, and fluid animations applied in different contexts:

•	 KumoApp → an app for Apple Watch, guiding breathing with organic shapes (Shape / Path).

🧑‍💻 Developer: Leandro Vansan de Morais
📅 Date: September 2025
🌍 Platforms: iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS
🎓 Course: iOS Lab School / Prof. Gustavo Cosme

⸻

🎯 Objectives
•	 Create minimalist experiences that convey calm, flow and balance.
•	 Apply animation concepts in SwiftUI to guide breathing intuitively.
•	 Explore modern navigation with NavigationStack on watchOS.
•	 Structure projects with MVVM-C, separating responsibilities.
•	 Use debugging logs in Xcode to track breathing cycles.
•	 Produce clean, scalable and ready to evolve code.

⸻

🚀 Features
•	 KumoApp (watchOS)
•	 Drawing of organic petals with Shape and Path.
•	 Animated breathing cycle (inspiration/exhalation).
•	 Navigation with NavigationStack.
•	 Manager for status control and practice sessions.
•	 Interface optimized for different Apple Watch sizes.
•	 Loop animation representing the respiratory cycle.
•	 Adjustable time control for breathing.
•	 Abstract and iconic design, inspired by minimalist logos.
•	 Light and dark theme compatibility.
•	 Unique icon based on the concept of controlled flow.
